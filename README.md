Python gui telnet client. Keep in mind that I've wrote it for Thomson TG582 and TG585. If your server or router is other brand or model, you should re-write the commands that are defined to the buttons or just use the "custom commands" field.
To use multiple custom commands separate them with a comma: command1,command2,command3,command4
