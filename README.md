Python gui telnet client. Keep in mind that I've wrote it for Thomson TG582 and TG585. If your server or router is other brand or model, you should re-write the commands that are defined to the buttons or just use the "custom commands" field.

## Requirements

* python2
* python-gobject (for debian is python-gi)
* webkitgtk, pywebkitgtk
